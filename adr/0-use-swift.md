# Let's Use Swift

*Programming will be done in Swift*

# Discussion

The target market is me, MarkD.  I use [Mac and
iOS](1-desktop-and-mobile.md).  When programming those, I use either
Objective-C or Swift.  Swift is the current hotness, so we'll use that.

Iot's got lots of features that will be useful (plus lots of complexity), and
I need more exercise in those, to be honest.

No plans on supporting Swift Embedded (sorry Playdate).  I'm not planning
on supporting Android, Windows or Linux.  So the APIs available in the apple ecosystem
are fair game.
