# Develop for Desktop and Mobile

**Mac and iOS - iPhone and iPad.  Not TV, VisionPro, or Watch**

# Discussion

I use the Mac.  And I like using the Mac (at least until macOS 26, which makes
me fundamentally sad).  I plan on being a Mac nerd using the Borkle apps to create
stuff - create the infocom maps, create the D&D projects. 

But it'd be nice to be able to create/edit on the go with an iPad.  Plus some
of the consumption apps (like Apple // reference) should absolutely shine on
mobile.

iPhone - eh, not sure if that'll be useful, but won't discount it now.

No plans on supporting the watch.  I don't have the vision for vision pro, and
I only use AppleTV once a month at cocoheads to make it much easier to share
the projector to anyone in the room.
