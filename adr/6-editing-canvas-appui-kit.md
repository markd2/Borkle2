# Editing Canvas is Appkit / UIKit

**The primary editing canvas with the bubbles, connections, etc, are to be written in AppKit or UIKit, not SwiftUI**

# Discussion

I know how to make editing canvases directly.  No messing around with collection views or whatever SwiftUI is going to use.  I don't trust them to have the knowledge of what needs updating or not.
